Task 1: Create a frequency distribution graph representing the price (that is a histogram with the highest possible number of bins - 267). Use data on all apartments and offices, no matter if sold or not.		
Task 2: Create a histogram which represents the Price variable. Choose interval width (bins) of length $100,000. If you don't know how to do that, refer to the Course notes on descriptive statistics provided with the first lecture in this section.		
              Use the data on all properties, no matter if sold or not.		
Task 3: Interpret the results.		
Task 4: Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between Price and Area. Use the data on all properties, no matter if sold or not. Interpret the results.		
Task 5: Create a frequency distribution table, where you list all the countries from which the company has buyers (country vs number of buyers). Count the absolute frequency, the relative frequency and the cumulative frequency. 								
Task 6: Create a Pareto diagram representing the data.				
Task 7: Calculate the mean, median, mode, skewness, variance and standard deviation of Price for all properties, no matter if sold or not.						
Task 8: Interpret the measures.						
Task 9: Calculate the covariance and correlation coefficient between Price and Area, no matter if the property is sold or not. Is the result in line with the scatter plot?
